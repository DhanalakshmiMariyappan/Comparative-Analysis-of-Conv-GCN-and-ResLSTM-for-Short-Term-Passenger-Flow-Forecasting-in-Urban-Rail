# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONV-GCN AND RESLSTM FOR SHORT-TERM PASSENGER FLOW FORECASTING URBAN RAIL TRANSIT


In this project, we are going to forecast the short-term passenger flow using advanced deep learning models: Conv-GCN and ResLSTM. Urban rail transit systems play a crucial role in the daily transportation of passengers in metropolitan areas. Efficient operation of these systems relies heavily on accurate short-term passenger flow forecasting, which can inform decisions related to scheduling, resource allocation, and congestion management. With the rapid advancements in deep learning technologies, there is a significant opportunity to enhance the precision of passenger flow predictions.
