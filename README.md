# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONV-GCN AND RESLSTM FOR SHORT-TERM PASSENGER FLOW FORECASTING URBAN RAIL TRANSIT


In this project, we are going to forecast the short-term passenger flow using advanced deep learning models: Conv-GCN and ResLSTM. Urban rail transit systems play a crucial role in the daily transportation of passengers in metropolitan areas. Efficient operation of these systems relies heavily on accurate short-term passenger flow forecasting, which can inform decisions related to scheduling, resource allocation, and congestion management. With the rapid advancements in deep learning technologies, there is a significant opportunity to enhance the precision of passenger flow predictions.

## The primary objectives of this study are to:
1.	Develop and refine the Conv-GCN and ResLSTM models for short-term passenger flow forecasting.
2.	Compare the performance of these models across different time granularities.
3.	Concentrate on reducing the values of key error metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both models.
4.	Provide insights and recommendations for subway operators to enhance operational efficiency through improved forecasting models.

By addressing these objectives, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on urban rail transit management and demonstrates the practical applications of advanced deep learning techniques in real-world scenarios.
